Travel Optimizer

Welcome to The Travel Optimizer, created by The Apptimizers!

Our application will allow travellers to quickly plug their destination into the search 
to pull Points of Interest from those cities. One click on that Point of Interest will 
display a photo of that POI, along with a quick description. Clicking on the "Show more 
at OpenTripMap" link below each description will link you to that POI's location on an
external map.

At the bottom of the page, you will find a custom satellite view map for scanning local
POI's. Just click on the location button on the map and allow the map to use your current
location. The map will then let you see nearby lodging, restaurants, historic sites, and more!

Have fun, and Safe Travels!
